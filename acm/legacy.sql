In general avoid using the word YOU.\n\r2) NEVER tell a player what he or she feels, while entering a room.\n\r   Different players feel different things and the feeling also vary\n\r   according to the level of the player.  It can be annoying to be told\n\r   that you feel afraid if the area is for level 10 players and\n\r   you are level 40.  It can also be irritating to be told you feel\n\r   safe, when you just fleed froma massive creature to the room.  These\n\r   kinds of phrases think for the player.  A good description is\n\r   supposed to get a player into a certain mood, not TELL them what\n\r   that mood is.\n\r3) NEVER tell the player how they are dressed or equipped, since this can vary\n\r   considerably.\n\r4) AVOID describing the creatures in the room, if they are reset there.\n\r   It looks rather silly to have a room description tell you that a\n\r   horrible, snarling minotaur is there looking at you as his next meal,\n\r   when in fact  his steaming guts are lying on the floor.  The creature\n\r   has its own decsription.  Describe any creatures that will be reset\n\r   in the creatures olc.  You can talk about creatures that are in the\n\r   general area though.  Such as:  The street is full of busy citizens\n\r   buying gods from local merchants, or something like that.  The citizens\n\r   themselves are not going to be resets in the room that the\n\r   player can interact with.\n\r5) Be careful how you describe the size and looks of things.  What\'s \'normal\'\n\r   to one player may not be to another.  A giant might think that the man\n\r   is rather short, but a pixie will think the man an enormous being.  A\n\r   beautiful woamn by human standards may be the ugliest thing on earth to\n\r   a dwarf.  Keep these things in mind.\n\r6) AVOID describing objects that will be reset in the room as well.  It\n\r   is ok to describe furniture that the players will not interact with, but\n\r   make sure you do not create a piece of furniture for them to sit in and\n\r   then also describe it in the room.  This makes for duplicate descriptions\n\r   and therefore is redundant.\n\r7) Remember that a room can usually be entered from different directions.\n\r   Do not say \"This room is much smaller than the one you just came from\"\n\r   People may not have come the same way to that room.  Again you should\n\r   avoid the word YOU anyway.\n\r8) AVOID statements about the weather.  If a weather code is put in and you\n\r   describe the room as bright and sunny, and the player gets a message\n\r   saying \"It begins to rain\", there will be a conflict.  If you want the\n\r   weather to be constant in an area, set the \'inside\' room flag on the\n\r   room.  This will generally prevent the weather messages from showing in\n\r   that paricular room.\n\r9) AVOID repeated descriptions as much as possible.  These should only happen\n\r   within a maze of some sorts, or large open spaces like fields or deserts.\n\r\n\rI know this is a lot of NEVER\'s and DO NOT\'s.

Room descriptions should be between 3 and 8 lines long.  It is nearly\n\r    impossible to get the sense or feel of a room from one line descriptions.\n\r2.

Some examples:\n\r    Along the Main Road\n\r    Inside the Northern Gate\n\r3.  Make sure to use proper grammer.  Know the difference between it\'s and its.\n\r    If you aren\'t sure which to use, look it up in a grammer book, or ask\n\r    someone.\n\r4.  There shall be two spaces between every sentence.  This is for all types\n\r    of descriptions (creature, room, and object).\n\r5.  Try to use neutral wording.  The description should fit with whatever\n\r    situation the player is in.  Instead of saying \"The bright sun reflects\n\r    off the sand, limiting visibility\", say \"On clear days, the sun reflects\n\r    off the sand, limiting visibility\".  This will allow the player to see\n\r    what\'s there under certain conditions.  If it\'s raining, the player will\n\r    know that it isn\'t clear and be able to get the \'sense\' of the room\n\r    based on his situation.  Using words like usually, often, sometimes, etc.\n\r    will help make things neutral.  Avoid using words like never or always.\n\r6.  Once your room is finished, proofread it.  After you have re-read it, do \n\r    it again.  Then, ask someone else to read it.  When that is completed,\n\r    contact the head builder for approval.\n\r7.  Creatures have both short and long descriptions.  The short description\n\r    must contain an article (a, an, the).  The long description must contain\n\r    the keyword for the creature or object.\n\r8.  Obtain a thesaurus!  This will be your friend.  Use of adjectives is what\n\r    makes a description.  On the other hand, use of the same adjectives over and\n\r    over can be rather annoying.  Use different words for a more enjoyable reading.\n\r9.  Above all, make sure that your area, room, creature, and object follow\n\r    the theme of the mud.  Not only the theme of the mud, but rooms, creatures\n\r    and objects should follow the theme of your area.
